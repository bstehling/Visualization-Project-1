Project 1 for CS4331: Visualization and Visual Analytics

CS4331.003: Special Topics in CS: Visualization and Visual Analytics

Data Description:

For project 1 I decided to use data from the National UFO Reporting Center at www.nuforc.org/. On this website they
have a database full of UFO reports which can be sorted by event date, state, shape of UFO, and date posted. The reports contain
a lot of information including a description of the sighting along with the time and place. I decided to categorize the reports by
shape for my project. Unfortunately, the NUFORC website database does not allow you to download data files to use so the data must
scraped from the website. Luckily I was able to find a .csv flie containing all the NUFORC report data precompiled online. Using this,
I was able to edit the file and take out all of the information that I was not going to need. My resulting csv file contained three
collumns for "Shape", "Date", and "Value". The NUFORC website contains quite a few different shapes of UFOs that they use for 
their reports. I chose the top 10 most reported shapes of UFOs to use in my project. I also included data for each month for past
5 years from 2013-2017. I narrowed down the csv file to just the data that I needed for my visualization which ended up being about
550 lines of data. Using this data, I was able to show the most viewed UFO shapes in the United States over a 5 year period.

Findings:

The visualization of my data proved to highlight some interesting facts about the reported UFOs from 2013 to 2017. Some of the
data was easy to explain and some was not. One of the shapes that I chose to visualize was the common shape of sphere. Often
when we see objects or bright lights in the sky, even if that may be a planet or star, they appear as spheres or balls of light.
The most populated shape in the UFO data was spheres by a large amount. This is understandable considering many objects in the sky
appear as spheres. As a result this trend did not suprise me. What did interest me was that there were certain times of each year
when the UFO reportings would peak. Some shapes even trended together in some parts of the chart. Some of the biggest peaks in the
data was at the beginning of each year which would be January. This could possibly be explained because of the fact that people 
like to celebrate New Years on January 1st, the first day of the year. The peak of UFO reports could have actually been sightings
of fireworks going off or some other form of New Year's celebration. Some shapes tended to align with each other which is an
interesting thing to view. For example, the shapes of oval and disk seemed to trend together very closely and seemed to rise and
fall at the same time. This is interesting because oval and disk are two very similar shapes. It is possible that many people saw
these objects in the sky at the same time around the world and reported them at the same time. This would explain the similar trend
in the data between the oval and disk shapes since these shapes are very similar and may have been reported simultaneasly by 
multiple people around the US. Overall, this project was a valuable experience to practice visualizing data and proved to reveal
some interesting things about the UFO report data.
